        <div class="summary">
            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>The report reveals a new campaign launched by the infamous hacker group Lazarus. The group compromised a software vendor by exploiting software vulnerabilities to deliver Lazarus malware. Despite the software vendor having released patches to control the situation, many organizations continued using the flawed version helping Lazarus infiltrate their systems. The report discloses that this software vendor had been struck by Lazarus multiple times before, pointing to a persistent and highly determined threat actor. <br><br>The Lazarus group demonstrated advanced evasion techniques, utilizing SIGNBT malware, which uses sophisticated methodologies to infect and control victims' systems. LPEClient, another malware strain noted in this attack, was observed executing targeted attacks associated with Lazarus. Previous campaigns displayed LPEClient as an initial infection vector, enabling effective victim profiling and facilitating the delivery of additional payloads.<br><br>Ultimately, Lazarus' new campaigns establish them as a significant and adaptable threat actor. Their techniques have evolved to include the manipulation of high-profile software vulnerabilities, allowing them to spread malware efficiently following initial infections. Whether the targets span industries or geographic locations, Lazarus' operations indicate their sophistication and relentlessness in achieving their objectives.</p>

            <h2>Threat Hunting Techniques:</h2>
            <p>1. Software and Vulnerability Assessment: The attacks primarily leveraged known vulnerabilities within legitimate software, hence the need for regular software updates and vulnerability assessment is crucial. Conduct frequent scans to identify vulnerabilities in your software systems, specifically scan for the SIGNBT malware and LPEClient tool known to be used by Lazarus.<br><br>2. Network Traffic Analysis: The Lazarus group exerts C2 communications with malicious servers to control their victims. Regularly perform network traffic analysis to identify unusual patterns, such as unexpected outbound data transfers or traffic associated with known malicious servers (as listed in the IoCs section).<br><br>3. DLL Monitoring: A significant part of Lazarus' techniques involves side-loading of malicious DLL files. Therefore, implementing monitoring for abnormal DLL activities (especially ualapi.dll as specified in the IoCs) is advisable.<br><br>4. HTTP Traffic Examination: The group communicates C2 commands via HTTP, using specific prefixes (e.g., SIGNBTLG, SIGNBTKE). Monitoring for HTTP POST data following these specific patterns could help in detecting the threat early.<br><br>5. Memory Forensics: The group used malware that operates entirely in memory without touching the disk, making detection challenging. Incorporating memory forensics analysis could be crucial to identifying stealthy malwares leveraging this technique.<br><br>6. Behavior Analysis: The malware used in the attacks has various behaviors, such as collecting system-level information, running files, and more. Monitoring for unusual behavior, particularly those aligned with the malware’s capabilities, can be effective.<br><br>7. Threat Intelligence: Import and monitor the indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided in the report, including the hashes of identified malwares and the domains of the C2 servers, in your cybersecurity tools and systems.<br><br>8. Security Awareness: Keep organizations updated about these emerging threats and reinforce the importance of hygiene factors such as not clicking on links/attachments from unknown sources and regularly updating systems/software.</p>

            <h2>Detection Rules:</h2>
            <p>**Rule Name: Lazarus APT Group Attack Detection**<br>**Purpose: Detection of activities related to the Lazarus advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting software vulnerabilities and employing specific malware variants (SIGNBT and LPEClient).**<br><br>This rule should be configured to trigger based on specific patterns and indicators of compromise detailed in the intelligence report.<br><br>**Implementation example (using Splunk's SPL):**<br><br>This example includes detections based on file hashes and known C2 servers, as well as the execution of specific Windows commands.<br><br>```<br>index=windows_logs EventCode=1 <br>| eval hash=coalesce(Hashes, NewProcessId) <br>| eval comms=coalesce(CommandLine, ProcessCommandLine) <br>| lookup known_bad_hashes hash OUTPUT known_bad_flag <br>| lookup known_Lazarus_C2 server OUTPUT known_bad_c2_flag <br>| rex field=comms "(?P<commands>reg|ping|netstat|systeminfo|wmic|sc|whoami|arp|nslookup|ver|net)"<br>| search known_bad_flag=1 OR known_bad_c2_flag=1 OR commands=* <br>| stats count<br>```<br><br>This SPL script will look into windows log events (EventCode=1), coalesce hashes, and command line fields. Then it checks for known bad hashes from a lookup table (`known_bad_hashes`) and known Lazarus C2 servers (`known_Lazarus_C2`). It also extracts potential command executions that match those often used by Lazarus. It will present statistics on these detections.<br><br>Note: The lookup tables (`known_bad_hashes` and `known_Lazarus_C2`), which are not included in this brief, should be the lists of known compute hashes for the Lazarus malware and the known C2 servers associated with Lazarus respectively. This implementation would require maintaining and updating these lists referred by lookup tables with up-to-date threat intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Mitre ATT&CK Framework Alignment:</h2>
            <p>The APT campaign by Lazarus implemented multiple tactics as per the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Here are some key tactics and their associated techniques:<br><br>1. Initial Access (T1189): In this instance, the exploitation of a software vulnerability was mentioned which is linked to ATT&CK technique T1189 (Drive-by Compromise).<br><br>2. Execution (T1203): The execution of malware like SIGNBT and LPEClient was observed, which alludes to the ATT&CK technique T1203 (Exploitation for Client Execution).<br><br>3. Persistence (T1547.012 and T1574.002): The creation of a file in the system folder and the recording of registry entries are tactics linked to techniques T1547.012 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder) and T1574.002 (Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading).<br><br>4. Defense Evasion (T1027.001 and T1027.002): The execution of malware in memory and tactics for maintaining persistence demonstrate the usage of ATT&CK techniques T1027.001 (Obfuscated Files or Information: Binary Padding) and T1027.002 (Software Packing).<br><br>5. Command and Control (T1071.001, T1132.002, and T1573.001): The C2 communication process for malware management uses techniques like T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols), T1132.002 (Data Encoding: Standard Encoding), and T1573.001 (Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography).<br><br>Based on these tactics and techniques, the following detection rules may be implemented:<br><br>- Monitor the anomalies in legitimate software to detect exploitation of vulnerabilities.<br>- Track the changes in the system folder and registry entries to notice unauthorized DLLs or registry changes.<br>- Examine network traffic for known malicious C2 server communication patterns.<br><br>Possible mitigation techniques include:<br><br>- Regular patching and update of software to reduce the chance of exploiting known vulnerabilities.<br>- Maintain least privilege principles and use application control to prevent unauthorized access to system files.<br>- Use network intrusion detection systems and network firewalls to monitor and block suspicious C2 communication.</p>

            <h2>Mitigations/Controls:</h2>
            <p>The post describes a complex and multi-layered attack conducted by the Lazarus group which includes compromising a software vendor, exploiting software vulnerabilities, and deploying multiple types of malware (SIGNBT, LPEClient). With these factors in mind, and based on the report, some mitigation steps could be:<br><br>1. **Patching and Updates:**<br>The vendor’s systems were compromised because they were using a version of the software with known vulnerabilities. Regular and timely updates and patches can resolve these issues.<br><br>2. **Monitoring and Detection:**<br>Deploy advanced threat detection solutions that can identify unusual behavior or anomalies such as the loading of a Windows executable file directly in memory or the creation of suspicious files/registry entries. <br><br>3. **Understanding Threat TTPs:**<br>The SIGNBT malware used certain unique characteristics such as specific communication headers (e.g., SIGNBTLG, SIGNBTKE, etc.). Organizations can leverage these known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) to configure their security solutions for specific detection and prevention measures.<br><br>4. **Segmentation and Isolation:**<br>Isolating sensitive systems from the rest of the network can prevent the lateral movement of threat actors and reduce the potential scope of a compromise.<br><br>5. **Security Training:**<br>Train personnel on cybersecurity best practices and how to identify and respond to malicious activity. This should also include teaching employees to avoid using untrusted software or software from unverified sources.<br><br>6. **Incident Response:**<br>Have a robust incident response plan in place to quickly identify and respond to cyber threats or breaches. This plan should include regular backups of data for recovery purposes.<br><br>7. **User-Machine Relations:**<br>The detailed description states that the malware only proceeds to the next step only if the “victim’s MachineGuid matches the expected one”. This suggests that single-user machines might be safer, and/or a monitoring for unusual MachineGuid-user relationships could be beneficial. <br><br>8. **Blocking Malicious IP/URLs:**<br>The Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) section lists out multiple IPs/URLs used by the malware for C2 server communications. Organizations can use this information to update their firewall policies and block these malicious communicated. <br><br>9. **Software Whitelisting:**<br>Only allow trusted applications to run on your organization’s systems. This can prevent unknown or untrusted software from introducing vulnerabilities or malicious activity. <br><br>10. **Anti-Malware Software:**<br>Regular scanning of systems for malware would help detect any malicious activities. It would be beneficial to use tools capable of analyzing threats in-memory.<br><br>An awareness of such attacks and their TTPs can help cyber defense teams stay proactive and prepare strategies to counteract them.</p>
